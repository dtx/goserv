This is a sample muxmapping directory, in order to test the sample_handlers move this directory to your $GOPATH and run server.go

In real world scenarios:
- all your mappings will be in a $GOPATH/muxmapping directory
- you will import your handler packages and teach goserv the names of your handlers as per server.go example
